            <h2>Noahwilson.tech: File Sharing</h2>

            <b id="a">Overview:</b><br>

            <p>The last part of my noahwilson.tech project is distributed file storage. I was able to use syncthing to crate directories that would be syncted up across all of my devices.</p>

            <b id="a">Technology:</b><br>

            <p>This one was pretty difficult. I first tried to set up a service called NextCloud, which would give me a very comprehensive google drive like experience. But, NextCloud refused to play nicely with my other programs so I had to scrap it.</p>
            
            <p>That's when I found Syncthing. Syncthing syncs the directories of every phone and computer you register with it. So, it's more similar to a shared external drive than a google docs account. It worked perfectly for my use case and installation was a breeze.</p> 
            
            <p>The issue came with trying to access it from outside of my cloud instance. Syncthing was designed to be accessed with a browser through the local host port on the computer that it's hosted on. To access it through my nginix server, I had to set up a reverse proxy. In the end it works and I have encrypted file syncing for all my devices.</p>

            <b id="a">Conclusion:</b><br>

            <p>With this last piece in place, I consider version 1 of my project complete. I'm looking forward to expanding into my little cloud ecosystem.</p>
