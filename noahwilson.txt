<strong>Overview:</strong>

To help me learn about Amazon Web Services, I purchased a domain and used it to help me experiment with their products. Today the domain hosts my personal website, and I hope to expand it to other services and projects.

<strong>Technology:</strong>

Noahwilson.tech is a serverless website hosted on Amazon's S3 product. Content delivery is handled by Amazon's CloudFront service. CloudFront also takes advantage of Amazon Certificate Manager to deliver the site with https. To increase security, the S3 bukets policy has been set up to take advantage of an origin access identity that was configured in CloudFront. This way, the bucket and it's contents can only be accessed through the CDN. Finally, I used Amazon's Route 53 to manage my DNS services.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

I really enjoyed putting this website together. What started out as an exercise to practice using AWS turned into a course on DNS services and ssl licenses. I learned a lot just trying to get ACM to work with my domain name provider. Right now it's only a small site, but I hope to expand it to help me study for the Amazon Solutions Architect Certification.
