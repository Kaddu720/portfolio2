            <a href="https://searx.me/" target="_blank">Make your own instance</a><br>

            <br>

            <b id="a">Overview:</b><br>

            <p>Everyone needs a good web browser but finding one is tough. Google and Bing openly spy on you. Duck Duck Go has a good reputation, but you can never be sure about it. So, why not host your own?</p>

            <b id="a">Technology:</b><br>
            <p>Searx is an open-source search engine polling application. When you give it a query, it polls multiple search engines and returns the most popular answers.Honestly, the deployment process if very straight forward and user friendly. Searx's development team created several scripts that take care of most of the installation. Most of my effort went into configuring the nginx server and my DNS settings to allow public access to my instance.</p>

            <b id="a">Conclusion:</b><br>
            <p>Out of all the parts of the project, this one was by far the easiest. The Searx installation scripts are fantastic and easy to use. Feel free to try out my instance at the link above.</p>
