<strong>Overview:</strong>

To help me learn about Amazon Web Services, I purchased a domain and used it to help me experiment with their products. Today the domain hosts my personal website, and I hope to expand it to other services and projects.

<strong>Technology:</strong>

Noahwilson.tech is a serverless website hosted on Amazon's S3 product. The domain, routing, and failover was configured in Amazon's Route 53 product. Finally, AWS CloudFront manages content delivery.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

I really enjoyed putting this website together. Right now it's only a small site, but I hope to expand it to help me study for the Amazon Solutions Architect Certification.
