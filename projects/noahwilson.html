            <b id="a">Overview:</b>

            <p>This entire project started as a college research assignment about privacy on the internet. That ballooned out into trying to replace as many of my daily internet utilities as possible. The domain noahwilson.tech is more than just the website you see here. My domain has has a search engine, an email client, file storage and much more!</p >

            <b id="a">Technology:</b>

            <p>Noahwilson.tech is hosted in the cloud on a virtual private server. Because the aim of the project was to be as "big tech" independent as possible, I tried to utilise open-source technology whenever I could. The core of my operation is an open-source Nginx web server. Every utility in my domain takes advantage of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Certbot tool. This allows my applications to utilise https.</p>

            <b id="a">Conclusion</b>

            <p>I really enjoyed putting this project together. What started out as a research paper, turned into a journey to digital independence. A full breakdown of my project and the corresponding research paper will be made available soon.</p>
