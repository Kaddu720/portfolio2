            <b id="a">Overview:</b><br>

            <p>The original purpose of this website was to be a  professional portfolio. It has since morphed into a hub for my project and the rest of my applications.</p>

            <b id="a">Technology:</b><br>

            <p> This is a very simple website utilising html, css, and vanilla javascript. My aim was to create something simple, modular, and highly modifiable. In the past I've worked with the web framework Django, and a lot of that design philosophy flowed into this site. I really enjoyed using the template system from that framework. It allowed me to break my sites up into several different modules and modify one part without disturbing anything else. I tried to recreate that using javascript. Several parts, like the terminal scroll on the home page and these project descriptions, are written in separate files and read in by a javascript typer. This allows me to have my "template" system in a much smaller package.</p>

            <b id="a">Conclusion:</b><br>

            <p>This site is a personal victory for myself. I can remember a few years ago when I had trouble building a linked list in python. Working on a javascript implementation of a feature that I found in a python framework would have looked impossible to me back then. I've had some fantastic teachers and I'm grateful to all of them.</p>
